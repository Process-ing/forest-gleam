# Forest Gleam

Repository for my final project for the 12th grade subject Computer Applications B.

# Objectives of the Project

The main goal of the project was to develop one of the following two: a computer game, using a game engine of our choosing, or a short film. For any of them, we had to create a full product, with a website, trailer, final report and presentation.

# Description of the Project

My group (Logical Soup Inc.) decided to create a game, which we called "Forest Gleam". This game features a mysterious character, who has to bring back the light to a cursed, endless forest. The player must choose their weapon and pick up powerups to defeat the countless enemies and collect the light once more.

This game was developed in Unity. It has a system with an infinite number of levels, all of them with procedurally generated terrain, and it has other nice features, like dynamic lighting, progress saving and loading, a sound system, a health and upgrade system, enemy pathfinding and more. All of our journey was documented in the [group website](https://rbrunopo.wixsite.com/logicalsoup) (only in Portuguese and, yes, it is a Wix website), where you can get more insights and also a download of our game (Warning: The website has not been maintained, as of May 2024, for a couple of years, and some links are now broken). 

The code of the project itself can be found here. Be mindful that this was a project made by high-schoolers, for a subject where we didn't even learn what subroutines or functions are, so some code may be kind of dubious. Nevertheless, the end product became way better than anything we thought we could achieve at that point. The code was only touched in two years to convert the project to the more recent version of Unity, the code stayed almost the same.
